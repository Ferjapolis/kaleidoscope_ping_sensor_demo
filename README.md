This is a stilly experiment using the following peices of hardware:

1 x Raspberry Pi
2 x NeoPixel jewel (7 LED's a piece)
1 x HC-SR04 ping sensor

The NeoPixels will display a rainbow pattern the varies depending on the distance measurement from the ping sensor. So moving your hand in front of the sensor will change the pattern.
